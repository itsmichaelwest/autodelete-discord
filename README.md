# AutoDelete
A Discord bot that will delete messages in a channel after a period of time. This is a great way to create "ephemeral" channels where messages persist for a few minutes or hours.

This bot makes use of the [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.
## Developing
Docs coming soon.
